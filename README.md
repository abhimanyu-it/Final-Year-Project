# Final-Year-Project

# Stock market forecasting using time series analysis

This project aims to predict stock market trends using three powerful models: ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet. Each model brings a unique approach to forecasting. ARIMA leverages statistical methods for trend and seasonality analysis, LSTM uses deep learning to capture long-term dependencies in data, and Prophet provides robust time series predictions with seasonality adjustments. By comparing these models, the project offers insights into their effectiveness and highlights key differences in predictive performance. This repository includes notebooks, data preprocessing, and model evaluation for a comprehensive analysis.
